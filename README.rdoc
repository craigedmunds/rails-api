This is a simple rails app showing
- A simple API that returns user information
- Sharing logic between the HTML based endpoints and the API
- The presentation/structuring of the API delegated to rabl views
- An Oauth provider via passport, with the V2 API being secured
- A simple API versioning example with the version number in the path, showing how to maintain backwards compatability between v1 & v2 codebases without duplicating code
